# Purpose
Code for tuning, training, testing, and applying a Random Forest machine learning behaviour classification model for accelerometer data. Developed as part of a collaboration with the "Performance Lab" at the University of Queensland. Data was collected by Gabriella Sparkes as a part of her PhD on koala behaviour. Based on the provided training data from captive individuals, I developed a classification model and applied the predictions to the unlabelled deployment data from free-roaming individuals.
