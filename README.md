# KoalaAnalysis
R script and workflow for analysing data from the UQ koala project. I collected data for this project in my honours and it has subsequently been continued by Gabby in her PhD. I aim to create a user-friendly workflow with a mixture of variable and user-input parameters that we can use to analyse this data under a range of conditions.
